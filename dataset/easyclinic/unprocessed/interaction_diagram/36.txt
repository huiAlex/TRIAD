Record visit 

The service is initiated upon the explicit request of the operator.
The operator accesses the main mask (for instance GUIPrincipale) and selects the "visit management" function.
Control is passed to the instance of GUIPrincipaleHandler, which delegates the task of providing the service to the instance of GUIVisitaHandler.
The first step is to obtain a list of all outpatient visits.
Control passes to the instance of VisiteManager, which iteratively retrieves data on all visits.
For each visit, the VisiteManager retrieves data on all examinations related to the visit through the instance of EsamiManager.
The list of visits and examinations is passed to the instance of GUIVisitaHandler, which displays the visits on the visit management mask (for instance GUIVisite).
The operator selects the "insert new visit" function and enters the data for the new visit.
The operator confirms the data entered, and control is passed to the instance of GUIVisitaHandler, which delegates the task of entering the new visit to the instance of VisiteManager.
The VisiteManager enters the new visit data through the visit panel and returns control to GUIVisitaHandler.
GUIVisitaHandler notifies the operator of the success of the operation by displaying a message on the visit management mask (for instance GUIVisita).
