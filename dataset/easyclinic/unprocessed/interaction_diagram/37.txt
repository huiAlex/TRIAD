input examination

The service is launched following the explicit request by the actor.
The operator logs on to the management of visits (for instance GUIVisita) and selects a visit to add an assessment.
The operator activates the function of inserting a new examination.
Control passes to the instance of GUIVisitaHandler, which delegates GUIEsameHandler to the instance of the task of providing the service.
The first step is to find information on the visit that the operator has selected; therefore, control passes to the application of VisiteManager through the application Visit.
VisiteManager retrieves information on the selected visit and passes control to the instance of EsamiManager.
Through the examination of bodies found, EsamiManager retrieves a list containing the information relating to the examinations of the selected visit.
The list is returned to the instance of GUIVisitaHandler, which ensures the display of the visit and examinations on the mask on the management of examinations (GUIEsami instance).
The operator inserts the data for the further examination and confirms the inclusion of the same.
At this point, the control switches GUIEsamiHandler to the instance of the delegation, which enters a new examination of the application latter EsameManager.
Through the application for review, EsameManager ensures the inclusion and saving of data for further examination and passes control to the instance of GUIEsameHandler.
GUIEsameHandler, in turn, deals with notifying success by viewing a special message in the mask on the management of examinations (for GUIEsame instance).
This feature was described by the collaboration diagrams of Fig 3.22.
