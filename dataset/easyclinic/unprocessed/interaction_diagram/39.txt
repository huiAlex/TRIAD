Access section patient failed (by code of Hospital Card)

The operator logs on to the form on the management section of the patient (body of GUILoginPaziente).
The operator inserts the code from the Hospital Card of the patient who has made a request and selects the function validation.
Control then passes to the application of GUILoginPazienteHandler, which delegates to the instance of HospitalCardManager the task of managing the service.
The latter is responsible for validating the data entered by the operator through the application of the Hospital Card.
If the validation fails, the transaction is notified backward up to the instance of GUILoginPazienteHandler.
GUILoginPazienteHandler shall display an error message on screen access (application of GUILoginPaziente).
This feature has been described by the sequence diagram of Fig 3.14.
