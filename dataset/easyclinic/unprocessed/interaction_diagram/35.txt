The operator selects the doctor to be eliminated and activates the function of disposal of medical data of their monitoring.
GUIAnagraficaMedicoHandler delegates the task of finding data for the selected doctor to the instance of MedicoManager.
The application of MedicoManager by the panel Doctor provides for the recovery of such data and will provide the application of GUIAnagraficaMedicoHandler.
GUIAnagraficaMedicoHandler displays the data on the mask GUIAnagraficaMedico.
At this point, the operator confirms the changes made, and control passes to the instance of GUIAnagraficaMedicoHandler.
The delegation eliminates the selected doctor by delegating the task to the instance of MedicoManager through the application of Doctor to provide.
