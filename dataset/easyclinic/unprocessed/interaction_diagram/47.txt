Show anagrafica
The service is launched following the explicit request by the Patient.
The actor Patient accesses the main screen (for instance GUIPrincipale) displaying all the services provided by the system to patients, and selects to display their anagrafica.
Control is passed to the instance of GUIPrincipaleHandler which delegates the task of managing the service to the instance of GUIAnagraficaHandler.
Control is then passed to the instance of PazienteManager which finds the patient data requested through the panel.
The patient data results are sent backward up to the instance of GUIAnagraficaHandler, which is responsible for displaying them on the screen that manages the patient registries (for instance GUIAnagrafica).
This feature is described by the collaboration diagram of Fig 3.9.
