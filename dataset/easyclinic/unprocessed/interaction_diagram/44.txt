Cancel Reservation 

The operator logs on to the main patient section (e.g. GUIPaziente).
The operator selects the cancellation of a reservation.
Control is passed to the instance of the GUIPazienteHandler, which delegates the task to manage the service to the instance of the GUIEliminaPrenotazioniHandler.
The GUIEliminaPrenotazioniHandler requests the PrenotazioniManager to obtain a list of all reservations from the patient.
The PrenotazioniManager retrieves the list through the reservation application and returns it to the GUIEliminaPrenotazioniHandler, which then displays the obtained data on the screen (e.g. GUIEliminaPrenotazione).
The operator selects the reservation to be deleted, and control is passed to the instance of GUIEliminaPrenotazioneHandler.
The GUIEliminaPrenotazioneHandler delegates the request to the PrenotazioniManager to complete the transaction of canceling the reservation.
The PrenotazioniManager verifies that the sequence remains valid even after the elimination of the reservation.
If the sequence is valid, the PrenotazioniManager completes the cancellation of the reservation and returns control to the GUIEliminaPrenotazioneHandler.
The GUIEliminaPrenotazioneHandler notifies the success of the transaction with a message on the screen (e.g. GUIEliminaPrenotazione).
This feature is described in the collaboration diagram in Fig 3 of 20.
