Changing laboratory anagrafica

The Operator logs on to the main form (for instance GUIPrincipale) and selects the function for laboratories certified management.
GUIPrincipaleHandler delegates the task to GUIAnagraficaLaboratorioHandler for providing the service.
The first step is to obtain a list of all laboratories, therefore control passes to the instance of LaboratorioManager through which instances of Laboratory retrieves the list and return it backward up the application of GUIAnagraficaLaboratorioHandler.
GUIAnagraficaLaboratorioHandler displays the list of laboratories received on the mask of the management of the database laboratories (for instance GUIAnagraficaLaboratorio).
The Operator selects the laboratory to change the active register function.
Control passes to the instance of GUIAnagraficaLaboratorioHandler which delegates the task to collect data on the selected laboratory to the instance of LaboratorioManager.
The latter, by the Laboratory of the application, retrieves the necessary data and supplies it to the instance of GUIAnagraficaLaboratorioHandler.
The instance of GUIAnagraficaLaboratorioHandler is responsible for displaying the data on the mask GUIAnagraficaLaboratorio.
The operator confirms the changes made.
Control passes to the instance of GUIAnagraficaLaboratorioHandler which delegates the task of storing the data in the laboratory considered to the application of LaboratorioManager.
The latter, through the body of the laboratory, provides the data to be saved.
Control passes backward up to the instance of GUIAnagraficaLaboratorioHandler which deals with notifying the success by viewing a special message on the screen on the management of the register of laboratories (for instance GUIAnagraficaLaboratorio).
This service is described through collaboration diagram of Fig 3.5.
