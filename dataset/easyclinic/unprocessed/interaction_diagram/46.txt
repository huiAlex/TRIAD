patient login failed validation Scenario

The service is launched following the explicit request by the Patient.
The actor Patient accesses the screen on the management of the system (for instance GUISfondo).
Control goes to the instance of GUISfondoHandler, which delegates to the instance of GUILoginHandler the task of managing the service.
The first step is to enter the Hospital Patient Card and PIN, and then Patient is presented with the same page for the acquisition of such data (for instance GUILogin).
The Patient enters data and confirms the inclusion. Control passes again to the instance of GUILoginHandler, which delegates validation to HospitalCardManager.
The Hospital Card unsuccessful operation is notified backward up to the instance of GUILoginHandler.
The instance of GUILoginHandler displays an error message on the form of access (for instance GUILogin).
This feature has been described by the sequence diagram of Fig 3.8.
