Patient Login Scenario validation run 

The Patient requests access to the system and accesses the management screen (GUISfondo).
Control is then passed to the GUISfondoHandler instance, which delegates the task of managing the service to the GUILoginHandler instance.
The Patient enters their Hospital Patient Card and PIN on the login page (GUILogin) presented by the system.
The Patient confirms the insertion of their data, and the control is returned to the GUILoginHandler instance for validation.
The HospitalCardManager application validates the information entered by the patient and returns the outcome to the GUILoginHandler instance.
If the validation is positive, the GUILoginHandler instance notifies the application to allow GUIPrincipaleHandler of access to the patient.
The GUIPrincipaleHandler instance then arranges for the display of the main form (GUIPrincipale) for the patient to use.
This feature was described by the sequence diagram of Fig 3.7
