Inserting anagrafica laboratory 

The Operator logs in to the main form (GUIPrincipale) and selects the certified laboratories management function.
GUIPrincipaleHandler delegates control to GUIAnagraficaLaboratorioHandler to provide the service.
GUIAnagraficaLaboratorioHandler obtains a list of all laboratories by passing control to the instance of LaboratorioManager, which retrieves the list of instances of Laboratory and returns it to GUIAnagraficaLaboratorioHandler.
GUIAnagraficaLaboratorioHandler displays the list of laboratories received on the GUIAnagraficaLaboratorio mask for managing the laboratory database.
The Operator selects the register inclusion function to insert the data of a new laboratory and confirms the data.
Control passes to the instance of GUIAnagraficaLaboratorioHandler to delegate the inclusion of a new laboratory.
GUIAnagraficaLaboratorioHandler delegates control to LaboratorioManager to include the new laboratory by passing it to the body of Laboratory to ensure the inclusion and saving data on the new laboratory.
LaboratorioManager returns control to GUIAnagraficaLaboratorioHandler, which deals with notification of the success of the inclusion by displaying a message on the screen for managing the laboratories (GUIAnagraficaLaboratorio).
The feature has been described through the collaboration diagram of Fig 3.4.
