Access section patient performed (by tax code)

The actor launches the service following an explicit request.
The Operator logs on to the management section of the patient form (body of GUILoginPaziente).
The Operator inserts the tax code of the patient who made the request and selects the function.
The validation of the data entered is then performed by the instance of GUILoginPazienteHandler which delegates the task to the instance of PazienteManager.
The PazienteManager validates the data entered by using the body of the patient and notifies the outcome.
The notification is sent backward up to the instance of GUILoginPazienteHandler.
GUILoginPazienteHandler requests the application of GUIPazienteHandler to enable access by the Section Patient applicant and display the main form (for instance GUIPaziente).
This feature has been described by the sequence diagram of Fig 3.13.
