Slipping on a visit to a later date 
The Operator logs on to the patient section form (for instance GUIPaziente) and checks the function of changing a reservation.
Control is passed to the instance of GUIPazienteHandler.
GUIPazienteHandler delegates the task of managing the service to the instance of GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler.
     
Uploading reservations
The instance of GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler is requested to obtain a list of all reservations made by the patient through the instance of GUISelezionaPrenotazioniHandler.
This object is passed for monitoring to the application of PrenotazioniManager through instances of reservation.
PrenotazioniManager finds that list and returns it to the instance of GUISelezionaPrenotazioniHandler.


Selecting the reservation to be change
The operator selects the reservation to edit from the list.
Control is passed backward up to GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler to delegate the task of transferring all information on the selected reservation to the instance of PrenotazioniManager.
The request is made to PrenotazioniManager through the application of Reservation to perform this task.
PrenotazioniManager returns the data obtained to the instance of GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler.
GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler gives the data obtained from PrenotazioniManager and displays it on the screen for reservation management (for instance, GUIPrenotaVisita).

     Request new date 
The operator requires a new date when the visit can be held.
Control passes to the instance of GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler.
The next available day is obtained by the appropriate body to ensure PrenotazioniManager.
The date is viewed in the mask on the management of reservations (for instance GUIPrenotaVisita).
The operator confirms the date proposed by the system.
Control is returned to the instance of GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler.

     Saving Reservation 
The application of class GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler proceeds with the reservation by delegating the task to the instance of PrenotazioniManager through the application for reservation.
PrenotazioniManager begins to validate the reservation, and only if the validation is successful, the data on the reservation is saved.
Once the operation is completed, control is returned backward to GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler.
The instance of GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler reports success with a message on the mask on the management of reservations (for instance GUIPrenotaVisita).
This feature is described by the collaboration diagram of Fig 3.19.
