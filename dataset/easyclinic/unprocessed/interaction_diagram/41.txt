reservation of first visit

The Operator logs on to the main form (for GUIPrincipale instance) and selects the function reservation an initial visit.
The Operator then passes control to GUIPrincipaleHandler, which delegates to the instance of the application GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler to manage the service.
Given that the reservation is for a first visit, control is passed to the application of which will be GUIAnagraficaPazienteHandler to integrate the patient's anagrafica data.

Creation of the new Patient
     
The application displays the class GUIAnagraficaPazienteHandler and the mask for inputting patient anagrafica data (for instance, GUIAnagraficaPaziente).
The operator enters the patient data and confirms it.
The operator then passes control to the instance of GUIAnagraficaPazienteHandler, which in turn is passed to the instance of PazienteManager.
The PazienteManager verifies if the patient is already within the SIO system. If the patient is not present, then the operation cannot proceed.
If the patient is present, GUIAnagraficaPazienteHandler continues to delegate to the instance of PazienteManager, which is tasked with creating a new patient.
The panel displays the creation of a new patient according to the data entered by the operator.

Creating the Hospital Card
     
The application of class PazienteManager passes control to the instance of HospitalCardManager.
HospitalCardManager creates a new Hospital Card to be assigned to Patient A.
After the creation, HospitalCardManager sends a notification message indicating the success of the operation.
The message is passed back up to the instance of GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler.
     

Choosing the type of visit
     
The application of class GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler displays the form for making a new reservation for a patient (for instance GUIPrenotaVisita).
The operator selects the type of visit and confirms the details.
Control returns to the instance of GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler.
The instance of GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler delegates the task of adding a new reservation to the instance of PrenotazioniManager.
     
Creating the new reservation
     
The application of class PrenotazioniManager creates a new reservation.
The body of Reservation verifies the validity of the reservation or checks that the new reservation respects the sequence of valid reservations.
If the reservation is valid, it notifies the success of the creation of a reservation and sends it backward up to the instance of GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler.


Finding available data
     
The proxy class GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler calls the instance of PrenotazioniManager to find the first available date for the visit.
PrenotazioniManager task finds the first available date and returns it to the instance of GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler.
The instance of GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler displays the available date on the reservation form (for GUIPrenotaVisita instance).
The operator confirms the date proposed by the system.
The control is returned to the instance of GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler.
     
Storing data on Patient and Hospital Card
     
The GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler instance passes control to GUIAnagraficaPazienteHandler to store data on the patient.
The GUIAnagraficaPazienteHandler instance delegates the task to store the personal data to PazienteManager.
PazienteManager stores the patient data permanently through the application of the Patient class.
Control is returned to HospitalCardManager to retrieve data on the hospital card for the patient who made the reservation.
Once the operations are completed, a message notifying the success of the process is sent backward to the instance of the GUIAnagraficaPazienteHandler.
     
Viewing and printing the Hospital Card

The application of the proxy class GUIAnagraficaPazienteHandler is used to view and print the Hospital Card.
The GUIHospitalCardHandler class obtains the Hospital Card data from the appropriate body in the HospitalCardManager.
The hospital card data is then displayed on the screen using the GUIHospitalCard display.
The GUIHospitalCardHandler delegates the printing of the Hospital Card to the instance of the PrintManager.
Control is then returned backward to the application GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler.


storing reservation
     
The application of class GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler proceeds to store the reservation.
This task is delegated to the instance of PrenotazioniManager through the application.
The application for reservation saves the data on the reservation.
Once this operation is complete, control passes to the instance of GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler.
GUIPrenotaVisitaHandler notifies success by viewing a special message on the screen on the reservation of a visit (for instance GUIPrenotaVisita).
This feature is described by the collaboration diagram of Figure 3.16.
