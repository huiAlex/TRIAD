A terrestrial position defined by a normal vector (N-vector) and an altitude.
An N-vector is a normal Vector that points out from the surface of the WGS-84  reference ellipsoid.
The normal vector is combined with an altitude which  represents the distance above (or below) the reference ellipsoid (note this  is the distance above sea level as sea level is defined as the surface of the  ellipsoid in WGS-84).
The n-vector and altitude together precisely define a  position on Earth.
The n-vector should be a unit vector (i.e. a vector with a  magnitude = 1).
The altitude should be in meters.
