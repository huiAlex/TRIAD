A position on Earth, represented as an X, Y and Z coordinate in an  Earth centered Earth fixed reference frame.
The origin of this frame is at the center of mass of the Earth.
The X-axis  points towards where the equator meets the prime meridean (latitude 0,  longitude 0).
The Z-axis points towards the geographic north pole (latitude  90, longitude undefined).
The Y-axis can be derived using right hand rule and  points towards latitude 0, longitude 90.
All units are in meters.
