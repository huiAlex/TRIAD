Uses the bisection method to iteratively hone in on the nvector that is	  metersToTravel distance away from the current n-vector along the path	  that goes from current to target.
A path can be thought of as the set of	  NVectors you can create by interpolating between current and target.
This	  code takes advantage of this to find the NVector on this path that is the	  right distance away from the current distance.
drone current position	  	             drone target position	  	             the distance the drone should travel along the path from	             current to target	  	          path that goes from current to target	 /
