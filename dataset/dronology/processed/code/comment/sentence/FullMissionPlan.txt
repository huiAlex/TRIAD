Manages a mission plan.
Each Mission plan has one FullMissionPlan instance, and one UAVMissionPlan instance for each UAV in the Mission plan.
Each of the UAV's individual mission plans are composed of MissionTasks.
Once the entire mission plan is loaded, a thread is created which checks each of the individual UAVMissionPlans to determine if they can start the next task.
