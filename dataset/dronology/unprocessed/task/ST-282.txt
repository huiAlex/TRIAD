[SUMMARY]
Following a UAV
[DESCRIPTION]
"Add a component above ""Emergency Operations"" called ""Map View Operations"". Add two button in it called ""Follow Selected UAVs on Map"" and ""View All UAVs on Map"". When no UAV is selected  the button ""Follow Selected UAVs"" is disabled; once a UAV is selected  the button is enabled.    Clicking on ""Follow Selected UAVs"" will automatically zoom and pan the map so that all selected UAVs (or rather the rectangle that bounds all selected UAVs) are always centered in the map and constitutes for about 60% of the view.    Clicking on ""View All UAVs"" will zoom and pan the map so that all UAVs and their planned routes (or rather the rectangle that bounds all UAVs and their planned routes) are centered in the map and constitutes for about 60% of the view."
