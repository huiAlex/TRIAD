   This routine is called when CUnit initializes this test   suite.  This can be used to allocate data or open any   resources required for all the test cases.  /

   This function performs the easy provision operation using   a UID/PWD to identify the client to the server.  This   is used for a variety of test cases in this module.  /
   Easy provision - HTTP basic auth, no client cert     This is a basic test to perform a a full trusted enroll   sequence of /cacerts, /csrattrs, and /simpleenroll using a   user ID and password to identify the client to the server.   No identity certificate is used by the client.  /
   Easy provision - with HTTP basic auth hint enabled, no client cert     This is a basic test to perform a a full trusted enroll   sequence of /cacerts, /csrattrs, and /simpleenroll using a   user ID and password to identify the client to the server.   No identity certificate is used by the client.  /
   Easy provision - client cert with HTTP basic auth enabled     This is a basic test to perform a a full trusted enroll   sequence of /cacerts, /csrattrs, and /simpleenroll using a   user ID and password to identify the client to the server.   No identity certificate is used by the client.  /
