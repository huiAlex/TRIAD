   This routine is called when CUnit initializes this test   suite.    1. Generate the keypair to be used for this EST Client UT suite  /
   This routine is called when CUnit uninitializes this test   suite.  This can be used to deallocate data or close any   resources that were used for the test cases.  /
   Callback function passed to est_client_init()  /
   This test case initializes an EST client context   using local CA certs, no client cert, and a valid public key,   no userid and password.  /
   This test case initializes an EST client context   using no local CA certs.  This is expected to be a successful initialization   since the local CA trust anchor certs are not mandatory.  /
   This test case initializes an EST client context   using a local CA cert, no client cert,   and a valid public key, no userid and password.  /
   This test case initializes an EST client context   using explict CA certs, no client cert, and a valid public key,   no userid and password.  /

   This test case tests the CA cert response verification function.  It will   verify a CAcert response containing a single certificate  /
   This test case tests the CA cert response verification function.  It will   verify a CAcert response containing a single chain with multiple certs  /
   This test case tests the CA cert response verification function.  It will   verify a CAcert response containing a single chain with multiple certs and   a missing cert in the chain.    /
   This test case tests the CA cert response verification function.  It will   verify a CAcert response containing a single chain with multiple certs    with the intermediate cert expired.  /
   This test case tests the CA cert response verification function.  It will   verify a CAcert response containing a multiple chains with multiple certs and   a CRL block.  The CRLs should be ignored.    /
   This test case tests the SSL read set timeout API.   The setting of the min, the max, a value in between, and a value   beyond the max.  /
 The main() function for setting up and running the tests.   Returns a CUE_SUCCESS on successful running, another   CUnit error code on failure.  /

       Print out the specifics of this cert      /
       Next call prints out the signature which can be used as the fingerprint       This fingerprint can be checked against the anticipated value to determine       whether or not the server's cert should be approved.      /
