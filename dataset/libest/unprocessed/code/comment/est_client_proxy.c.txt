       All we want libcurl to do here is establish the connection to       the proxy server.  Once that's done we'll use the socket       as we normally do on a direct connect to the EST server      /

           As per:           https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms740126(v=vs.85).aspx                     Ioctl and Ioctlsocket/WSAIoctl                     Various C language run-time systems use the IOCTLs for purposes           unrelated to Windows Sockets. As a consequence, the ioctlsocket           function and the WSAIoctl function were defined to handle socket           functions that were performed by IOCTL and fcntl in the Berkeley           Software Distribution.                     Since ioctlsocket is the Windows equivalent of ioctl/fcntl, just           set return type accordingly.          /
